                <article> <h1> Travel </h1><h2>The Russian adventure</h2>
                  <p>Originally, I was going to Moscow to see my brother who was spending his exchange studying at a university there. There were many obstacles when it came to my planning of the trip – the visa application was long and tedious. But, with the help of the visa center in Prague, I managed it and so me and my best friend Barbora boarded the plane to Sheremetyevo airport in Moscow!
                  </p>

                  <p>Arriving to Moscow was a bit depressing – it was heavily raining and the airport isn´t amongst the modern places around the city. And as we were trying to find our way around the place, attempting to speak to taxi drivers who spoke only Russian, we were hoping that our experience would get better.
                  </p>
                  <p>And it surely did. When the taxi took us to the hotel and we met with my brother, we immediately set to discover the city center – and Moscow astonished me. It was so unique even now I cannot describe it with words: the city was so diverse I couldn´t believe how many different things could exist at one place. The architecture was amazing – a majestic cathedral arching over the street and a dirty side valley full of trash bins and plastic bottles on the ground – both in the same street, connected to each other. Old crumbling buildings standing in line with new modern houses.

                  <p>“Moscow is beautiful when you live in it but ugly when you visit it.” – those are the words that my brother used. Yet even though I was staying only for a week I already felt the “spell” of the city – many people around the world think that the Russians are hostile and angry people that are constantly acting unfriendly. The opposite was mostly true – yes, there were people who frowned when I started talking English, but a majority of people whom I talked to was so happy and excited to see a tourist, they offered me more help than I even originally asked for.

                  <p>And so, after my brief visit of the Russian Federation, I was leaving with a very strange feeling – a feeling that I missed so much and that I didn´t manage to see everything. With my suitcase in my hand and so many diverse sights in my mind, I was flying back to Czech Republic thinking only one – Moscow is a place that I need to visit again. And that again is going to be very soon. Also, If you have a feeling of

                  <p>Studying in the Hague was once my dream and still is… whilst trying not to be homesick, I cover myself in books and basically keep myself occupied (mostly travelling). I often just take a bike and. That’s it. Riding. Somewhere. Without knowing the final destination. I’d describe myself as a wanderer and pilgrim, fighting in the dark. I want to show you a few places I truly enjoyed being part of.

                  <p>Wateringen… a part of city truly close to me. A place where I spent most of my student life. I love to just being there, being part of something. It’s not describable by words - you have to see it on your own.

                  <p>Lastly, the most beautiful, astonishing and peaceful place on the Earth. Kijkduin is its name. A beach! I can not even explain the magic you feel there - oh god! Order a beer and watch waves of the ocean dancing - just do it.
